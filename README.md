# I wrote this program to extract information from an W2 image file.
# The program will take the input from a W2 image in .jpg format having a lot of information 
# it then generate it into a PDF file
# I will integrate ChatGPT API into the program that takes the PDF file, extract all information and return the information in JSON data (key : value)
# the program then get the wanted information and display it 
# I also created a simple web page to take the input and display the output
# (There are some other way to extract the information without using the ChatGPT API such as OCR tool in Python, however the data file needs to be well-structured and consistent)
